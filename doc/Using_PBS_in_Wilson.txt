To run NRG_main with PBS batch files do:

1) Write a script file containing:

========
#!/bin/sh 
#PBS -N job_test
#
#PBS -e job_test.error 
#
#PBS -o job_test.output
#
#PBS -l nodes=1 
NRG_main > output_pbs_test.txt 
echo "Finished NRG  > Finish_test
========

(Obs: to run with "PowerLaw" option, replace command line above with

NRG_main -b PowerLaw > output_pbs_test.txt 
)

2) Save the above in a file (for example, PBS_script)
and run 
===
$qsub PBS_script
===

3) To check the status, do
===
$qstat
===
