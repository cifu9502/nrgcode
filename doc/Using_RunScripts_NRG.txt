1- Running NRG in ./runNN directories
========
A very common task using the NRG code is to do several runs changing only 
one or perhaps two paramenters at a time. Let's get a concrete example:

The "vanilla" Anderson model has 3 parameters: ed, U and Gamma. Let's say
I want to do 7 different runs with U=0.5, Gamma=0.01 and 7 ed values: 
ed=-0.4,-0.35,-0.3, -0.25,-0.2, -0.15,-0.1 

That means, 7 different input_nrg.dat files, in which would have the following structure:

===
51 <-- Nsites: line 0 
1000 <-- Nstates: line 1
0.5  <-- U : line 2
0.01 <-- Gamma: line 3
-0.4 <-- ed: line 4 (varying this one)
2.5  <-- Lambda
0   <-- chemical potential (=0 by default)
0   <-- always zero (for historical reasons)
0   <-- Update Before cut? [0 - no (dafault) 1- yes]
0   <-- calculate what? [0- 1-body observables, 1- spectral densities, 2-Thermodynamics, 3- Chain thermodynamics, etc.]
9999999 <-- marker (any integer)
(..)
===

So, what do you do? You say: "Well, I just make 7 copies of input_nrg.dat and edit line 4 (starting from 0) above to change ed". Yeah, what if you have 1000 runs instead of 7? Will you edit each one of them manually?

The script "ChangeNRGParams.perl" can help to make changing the parameters in input_nrg.txt  automatically. For that, you need to create "runNN" (NN->number) directories, one for each NRG run. In the example above, we create

$mkdir ./run1
$mkdir ./run2
(...)
$mkdir ./run7

and place a copy of the above input_nrg.file (with U=0.5, Gamma=0.01 and ed=-0.4) in each one of them. Also, create a symbolic link to NRG_main in each one.

Once you are done, make a symbolic link to "ChangeNRGParams.perl" and run

$ChangeNRGParams.perl -h

will give you the options. In this example, we are doing

$ChangeNRGParams.perl -i 1 -f 7 --choiceparam=4 --p0=-0.4 --pstep=0.05 

Meaning: please change the values of line 4 (starting from 0) in files "input_nrg.dat" (default) located in dirs "./run1" through "./run7", starting from -0.4 in ./run1 and increasing this value by 0.05 as you go to the next dir.
