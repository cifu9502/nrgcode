# TwoChNRG
Flexible Numerical Renormalization Group (NRG) code.
Please see Documentation in ./doc/ for details on compilation, etc.

The main code was written by my adivisor Luis Dias http://www.fmt.if.usp.br/~luisdias/. 
My work is focused on adapting this code to implement the model of a double quantum dot coupled to a Majorana wire. We used this results to characterize the movements of the majorana inside the dots. 

I will add a preprint soon...
